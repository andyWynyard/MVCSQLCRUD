# MVCSQLCRUD - An interactive Bucket List webapp.

This is a reimagining of the previous BucketList where the file storage mechanism for the project is a sql database instead of a csv file.

The changes made so far made it quite difficult to deploy with the same Controller/DAOImpl combination. Thus extensive changes have been made in how the Controller/DAO/POJO's interact with one another. This has caused a bit of a backlog of work, however it could have been worse.
